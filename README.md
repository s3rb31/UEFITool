# UEFITool\_mod

This version of UEFITool enables you to directly save all files that are found with a text search, so you don't have to dump them manually.

## How to use

The "Action" menu has a new option "Found files" which will be activated upon a successful search:

![UEFITool-mod-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3rb31/UEFITool/new_engine-mod/images/new_menu_entry.png "New search dialog option")  

Upon selecting one of the extraction options, the following dialog will appear. It will ask you to select a directory to save found files to:

![UEFITool-mod-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3rb31/UEFITool/new_engine-mod/images/dir_select_dialog.png "Directory select dialog")  

Et voil√†, all the found files are extracted to the selected directory.
