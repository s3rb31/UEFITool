# UEFITool\_mod

This version of UEFITool enables you to directly save all files that are found with a text search, so you don't have to dump them manually.

## Example

The text search dialog has a new option "Dump files?":

![UEFITool-mod-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3rb31/UEFITool/new_engine/images/new_search_option.png "New search dialog option")  

The following dialog will appear immediately after pressing the "Ok" button. It will ask you to select a directory to save found files:

![UEFITool-mod-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3rb31/UEFITool/new_engine/images/dir_select_dialog.png "Directory select dialog")  

Once a directory is selected, there will be some output in the "Search" tab indicating the extraction status of each found file:

![UEFITool-mod-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3rb31/UEFITool/new_engine/images/search_output.png "Directory select dialog")

Et voil√†, all the found files are extracted to the selected directory.
